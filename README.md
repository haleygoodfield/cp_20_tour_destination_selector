# Tour Destination Selector
### Project Overview
This is my twentieth coding project, where I built a **React Tour Explorer app** that allows you to: 
- Fetch and display a list (name, price, image, description) of tour destinations from a remote API.
- Select a destination from a dropdown list.
- View only the selected tour or all tours.

### Built With
- React & Vite
- useState & useEffect
- CSS 

### To Run It
1. Open terminal
2. Run: npm install
3. Then, run: npm run dev
4. Open the local host: http://localhost:5183/

**Note: API is fetched through CORS proxy**
- This may take a few seconds to respond, please wait for the tours to load!
